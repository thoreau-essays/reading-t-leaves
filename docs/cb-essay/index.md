# CB-Essay Documentation

Welcome to CB-Essay! This guide will help you create multimodal essays and monographs that integrate digital collection items with long-form narrative writing.

## What is CB-Essay?

CB-Essay is a Jekyll-based static site generator that extends [CollectionBuilder-CSV](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-csv) to support essay and monograph publishing. Write in Markdown, integrate collection items with simple includes, and publish beautiful, accessible scholarly work.

**Perfect for:**
- Digital humanities projects and digital editions
- Annotated texts with primary source integration
- Scholarly essays that incorporate archival materials
- Multimodal monographs
- Publishing public domain texts with scholarly apparatus

## Core Concepts

### The Dual-Collection Model

CB-Essay manages two parallel collections:

1. **Essay Collection** (`_essay/` folder)
   - Your narrative content as Markdown files
   - Sequential navigation with prev/next buttons
   - Controlled by `order` field in front matter

2. **Object Collection** (CSV metadata)
   - Digital collection items
   - Metadata-driven pages
   - Standard CollectionBuilder features (Browse, Map, Timeline)

These collections work together - reference collection items within your essays using simple includes.

### Essay Front Matter

Every essay file needs YAML front matter:

```yaml
---
title: Your Essay Title
order: 1
byline: Your Name (optional)
---
```

Essays display in sequential order based on the `order` value.

### Theme Options

CB-Essay's navigation and homepage behavior are independent flags in `_data/theme.yml`, not a single essay-vs-monograph switch:

- **`show-contents-nav`** - Adds a "Contents" button to the navbar that opens the essay chapter list
- **`show-homepage-toc`** - Displays a table of contents on the homepage
- **`show-section-nav`** - Adds a floating H2-based sidebar on essay pages (wide screens)

Turn all three off for a single linear essay, or on for a book-like multi-chapter monograph. See [Theme Options](theme-options.md) for common configurations.

## Essential Features

### Essay-Specific Includes

- **Blockquotes** - Styled quotations with attribution
- **Asides** - Margin notes with optional collection items
- **Image Galleries** - Display multiple items
- **Mini Maps** - Embed maps at specific coordinates
- **Section Transitions** - Visual breaks with scroll effects

See the [Essay Features Reference](essay-features.md) for complete documentation.

### CollectionBuilder Integration

See [Essay Writing Features](../../_essay/04-essay-features.md) for essay-embeddable examples, or [CollectionBuilder's documentation](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/) for the full feature set.
